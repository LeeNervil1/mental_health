In Plain English, blindness is defined as the disability to see. Some causes of blindness can be age-related eye diseases, childhood blindness, or eye surgeries. It is very frustrating for blind and visually impaired people to use the browsers. For instance, screen readers allow blind computer users to have access to the Internet.

Hearing loss is when a person has problems with hearing or hears nothing at all. There are three types of hearing loss, such as conductive, mixed, and sensorineural. According to CDC, studies have shown that 1.4 per 1000 babies have been identified with hearing loss. This physical disability is one of the most common birth defects, which means hearing loss is caused during pregnancy.
